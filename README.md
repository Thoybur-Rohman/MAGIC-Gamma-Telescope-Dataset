# MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset Classification

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for performing classification on the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset. The dataset consists of measurements taken by the MAGIC gamma-ray telescope, and the goal is to develop machine learning models that can classify events as either signal (gamma-rays) or background noise.

## Dataset Description

The MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset provides a set of features derived from the telescope's observations, such as signal intensity, shape, and size of the recorded events. The dataset is labeled, with each event marked as either a gamma-ray signal or background noise.

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks are provided for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. These notebooks offer a step-by-step walkthrough of the classification process.
  
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for various tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and testing.

- **Models**: Saved machine learning models that have been trained on the dataset. These can be used for inference without the need for retraining.

- **Results**: Reports, visualizations, and metrics generated during the model training and evaluation phases.

## Getting Started

To get started with classification on the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
